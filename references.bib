abstract = {In this paper, we present two novel algorithms to realize a finite dimensional, linear time-invariant state-space model from input-output data. The algorithms have a number of common features. They are classified as one of the subspace model identification schemes, in that a major part of the identification problem consists of calculating specially structured subspaces of spaces defined by the input-output data. This structure is then exploited in the calculation of a realization. Another common feature is their algorithmic organization: an RQ factorization followed by a singular value decomposition and the solution of an overdetermined set (or sets) of equations. The schemes assume that the underlying system has an output-error structure and that a measurable input sequence is available. The latter characteristic indicates that both schemes are versions of the MIMO Output-Error State Space model identification (MOESP) approach. The first algorithm is denoted in particular as the (elementary MOESP scheme)...},

@article{Yuan2020,
abstract = {There has been a surge of interests in the security of cyber-physical systems (CPSs), yet it is commonly assumed that the adversary has a full knowledge of physical system models. This paper argues that such an unrealistic assumption can be relaxed: the adversary might still be able to identify the system model by passively observing the control input and sensory data. In such a setup, the attack with knowledge of input-output data can be categorized as a Known-Plaintext Attack. A necessary and sufficient condition has been provided, under which the adversary can uniquely obtain the knowledge of the underlying physical system. From the defender's perspective, a secure controller designâ€”which exhibits a low rank structureâ€”is proposed which renders the system unidentifiable to the adversary, while trading off the control system's performance. Finally, a numerical example has been provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed secure controller design.},

@inproceedings{Park2019,
abstract = {In this paper, we address the problem of constructing a robust stealthy attack that compromises uncertain cyber-physical systems having unstable zeros. We first interpret the (non-robust) conventional zero-dynamics attack based on Byrnes-Isidori normal form, and then present a new robust zero-dynamics attack for uncertain plants. Different from the conventional strategy, our key idea is to isolate the real zero-dynamics from the plant's input-output relation and to replace it with an auxiliary nominal zero-dynamics. As a result, this alternative attack does not require the exact model knowledge anymore. The price to pay for the robustness is to utilize the input and output signals of the system (i.e., disclosure resources). It is shown that a disturbance observer can be employed to realize the new attack philosophy when there is a lack of model knowledge. Simulation results with a hydro-turbine power system are presented to verify the attack performance and robustness.},

@article{Mo2011,
abstract = {It is often appealing to assume that existing solutions can be directly applied to emerging engineering domains. Unfortunately, careful investigation of the unique challenges presented by new domains exposes its idiosyncrasies, thus often requiring new approaches and solutions. In this paper, we argue that the "smart" grid, replacing its incredibly successful and reliable predecessor, poses a series of new security challenges, among others, that require novel approaches to the field of cyber security. We will call this new field cyber-physical security. The tight coupling between information and communication technologies and physical systems introduces new security concerns, requiring a rethinking of the commonly used objectives and methods. Existing security approaches are either inapplicable, not viable, insufficiently scalable, incompatible, or simply inadequate to address the challenges posed by highly complex environments such as the smart grid. A concerted effort by the entire industry, the research community, and the policy makers is required to achieve the vision of a secure smart grid infrastructure.},

abstract = {This paper addresses the detection and isolation of replay attacks on sensor measurements. As opposed to previously proposed additive watermarking, we propose a multiplicative watermarking scheme, where each sensor's output is separately watermarked by being fed to a SISO watermark generator. Additionally, a set of equalizing filters is placed at the controller's side, which reconstructs the original output signals from the received watermarked data. We show that the proposed scheme has several advantages over existing approaches: it has no detrimental effects on the closed-loop performance in the absence of attacks; it can be designed in a modular fashion, independently of the design of the controller and anomaly detector; it facilitates the detection of replay attacks and the isolation of the time at which the replayed data was recorded. These properties are discussed in detail and the results are illustrated through a numerical example.},

abstract = {This paper considers the problem of designing physical watermark signals in order to optimally detect possible replay attack in a linear time-invariant system, under the assumption that the system parameters are unknown and need to be identified online. We first provide a replay attack model, where an adversary replays the previous sensor data in order to fool the system. A physical watermarking scheme, which leverages a random control input as a watermark to detect the replay attack, is then introduced. The optimal watermark signal design problem is cast as an optimization problem, which aims to achieve the optimal trade-off between control performance and intrusion detection. An online watermarking design and system identification algorithm is provided to deal with systems with unknown parameters. We prove that the proposed algorithm converges to the optimal one and characterize the almost sure convergence rate. A numerical example and an industrial process example are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.},

abstract = {The resilience of Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems for electric power networks for certain cyber-attacks is considered. We analyze the vulnerability of the measurement system to false data attack on communicated measurements. The vulnerability analysis problem is shown to be NP-hard, meaning that unless P=NP there is no polynomial time algorithm to analyze the vulnerability of the system. Nevertheless, we identify situations, such as the full measurement case, where the analysis problem can be solved efficiently. In such cases, we show indeed that the problem can be cast as a generalization of the minimum cut problem involving nodes with possibly nonzero costs. We further show that it can be reformulated as a standard minimum cut problem (without node costs) on a modified graph of proportional size. An important consequence of this result is that our approach provides the first exact efficient algorithm for the vulnerability analysis problem under the full measurement assumption. Furthermore, our approach also provides an efficient heuristic algorithm for the general NP-hard problem. Our results are illustrated by numerical studies on benchmark systems including the IEEE 118-bus system.},

The first result establishes that this problem is, in general, NP-hard. We then identify classes of subproblems that can be solved in polynomial time. When there are at most s malicious sensors, the problem can be solved in polynomial time when each eigenvalue is observable by at least 2s+1 sensors. When each eigenvalue has geometric multiplicity one, this condition is equivalent to the system being 2s-sparse observable. In contrast, the situation becomes more nuanced when each eigenvalue is not observable by at least 2s+1 sensors, as we describe in detail in the paper.},

@article{Fawzi2014,
abstract = {The vast majority of today's critical infrastructure is supported by numerous feedback control loops and an attack on these control loops can have disastrous consequences. This is a major concern since modern control systems are becoming large and decentralized and thus more vulnerable to attacks. This paper is concerned with the estimation and control of linear systems when some of the sensors or actuators are corrupted by an attacker. We give a new simple characterization of the maximum number of attacks that can be detected and corrected as a function of the pair (A,C) of the system and we show in particular that it is impossible to accurately reconstruct the state of a system if more than half the sensors are attacked. In addition, we show how the design of a secure local control loop can improve the resilience of the system. When the number of attacks is smaller than a threshold, we propose an efficient algorithm inspired from techniques in compressed sensing to estimate the state of the plant despite attacks. We give a theoretical characterization of the performance of this algorithm and we show on numerical simulations that the method is promising and allows to reconstruct the state accurately despite attacks. Finally, we consider the problem of designing output-feedback controllers that stabilize the system despite sensor attacks. We show that a principle of separation between estimation and control holds and that the design of resilient output feedback controllers can be reduced to the design of resilient state estimators.},

abstract = {We consider the problem of resilient state estimation in the presence of integrity attacks. There are m sensors monitoring the state and p of them are under attack. The sensory data collected by the compromised sensors can be manipulated arbitrarily by the attacker. The classical estimators, such as the least squares estimator, may not provide a reliable estimate under the so-called (p,m)-sparse attack. In this paper, we are not restricting our efforts to studying whether any specific estimator is resilient to the attack or not, but instead we aim to present some generic sufficient and necessary conditions for resilience by considering a general class of convex optimization based estimators. The sufficient and necessary conditions are shown to be tight, with a trivial gap. We further specialize our result to the scalar sensor measurements case and extend our framework to incorporate estimators with correlated cost function optimization. Experimental results tested on the IEEE 14-bus test system validate the theoretical analysis.},
