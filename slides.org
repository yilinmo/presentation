#+KEYWORDS: Cyber-Physical System, Networked Control, Security, Control
#+DESCRIPTION: A brief overview of the current researches on control and CPS.

* Introduction
** Definition of Cyber-Physical System
 
** Hybrid Systems
   
** Sensor Networks

** Networked Control System   

* Networked Control System


  
* Security and Privacy of CPS

** Security Risks 
  - The next generation CPS: *Smart Grids*, *Smart Buildings*, *Internet of Things*, will make extensive use of widespread sensing and networking.
  - As the CPSs become "/smarter/", they are also more vulnerable to malicious attacks.

*** The First CPS Malware: Stuxnet

  - Stuxnet is the first discovered malware that spies on and subverts industrial control systems. It was discovered in June 2010.

*** Threats to Industrial Control Systems
   
- In FY 2016, ICS-CERT received *290* incidents. The scope of incidents includes: {{{reveallicense("./cert.meta","40vh",nil,'none)}}}
  * Unauthorized access, 
  * Exploitation of zero-day vulnerabilities,  
  * Malware infections within air-gapped control system networks.

*** Attack Through Supply Chain

- 70% of the components for Boeing 787 are manufactured by other suppliers.

*** Black Energy

- A Successful attack on *critical infrastructure* can be devastating.
