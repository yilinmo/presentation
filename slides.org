#+TITLE: 信息物理系统
#+AUTHOR: 莫一林(清华大学  自动化系)
#+DATE:  信息物理系统专委会 (Aug 21, 2020)

#+KEYWORDS: Cyber-Physical System, Networked Control, Security, Control
#+DESCRIPTION: A brief overview of the current researches on control and CPS.

* Introduction
** Definition of Cyber-Physical System
 
** Hybrid Systems
   
** Sensor Networks

** Networked Control System   

* Networked Control System


  
* Security and Privacy of CPS

** Smarter CPS  
  - The next generation CPS: Smart Grids, Smart Buildings, Smart Home, Internet of Things, will make extensive use of widespread sensing and networking.
  - As the CPSs become "smarter", they are also more vulnerable to malicious attacks.
 
** Stuxnet

  - Stuxnet is the first discovered malware that spies on and subverts industrial control systems. It was discovered in June 2010.
  
** Industrial Control Systems
   
  In FY 2016, ICS-CERT (Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response Team) received and responded to *290* incidents. The scope of incidents includes but not limited to the following:
  - Unauthorized access and exploitation of Internet facing ICS/Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) devices,
  - Exploitation of zero-day vulnerabilities in control system devices and software, 
  - Malware infections within air-gapped control system networks,

** Attack Through Supply Chain
   
** Black Energy
